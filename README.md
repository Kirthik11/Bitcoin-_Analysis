Description:

In this project, we explore the historical trends and volatility of Bitcoin prices using a dataset spanning a period of time. The analysis encompasses various stages of data preprocessing, visualization, and basic time series analysis techniques to gain insights into the behavior of Bitcoin prices over time.

Data Preprocessing:

The project begins with importing the necessary libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. We load the Bitcoin price dataset from a CSV file and inspect its structure, checking for missing values and duplicates. The 'Date' column is converted to a datetime format to facilitate time series analysis.

Data Visualization:

We visualize Bitcoin price trends using line plots for open, high, low, and close prices over the entire dataset. Additionally, candlestick charts are generated using Plotly to illustrate the price movements within a selected sample period, providing a detailed view of price fluctuations.

Data Transformation and Scaling:

To prepare the data for analysis, we transform the dataset by setting the 'Date' column as the index. Scaling techniques such as log scaling are applied to better visualize the distribution of Bitcoin prices and address potential skewness in the data.

Time Series Analysis:

Time series analysis is conducted by resampling the Bitcoin closing prices to calculate mean prices over yearly, quarterly, and monthly intervals. Percentage changes in Bitcoin closing prices are computed to analyze the volatility and trends in price movements over time.

Interactive Visualization:

Interactive visualization tools such as Plotly and Cufflinks are employed to create interactive plots of Bitcoin closing price percentage changes. These visualizations enhance the exploration of Bitcoin price data by providing interactive features for detailed examination and analysis.

Conclusion:

Through this project, we gain valuable insights into the historical trends and volatility of Bitcoin prices. The analysis enables us to identify patterns, fluctuations, and key trends in Bitcoin market behavior, facilitating a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving Bitcoin price movements over time.
